✈️ Airline Stocks & Tourism Forecasting Project
This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the airline industry by applying a wide range of econometric, statistical, and machine learning models. By focusing on forecasting, risk estimation, and dynamic relationships, we uncover key insights into the tourism sector.

🔍 Main Objectives

📈 Forecasting Trends
Build accurate forecasting models using SARIMA, State Space Models, and deep learning (RNN) to capture seasonality, trends, and structural factors affecting airline stocks.

📉 Volatility Estimation
Apply ARCH-GARCH models to analyze stock price volatility, offering insights into market risk and investor sentiment in the tourism sector.

📊 Spectral Analysis
Use spectral analysis techniques to detect cyclic patterns and seasonal periodicities in airline stock movements.

🔄 Multivariate Analysis
Investigate the causal and dynamic relationships between airline stocks and passenger traffic using VAR, multivariate GARCH, and SVAR models.

🔗 Long-Term Equilibrium
Explore long-run equilibrium relationships between tourism-related variables (airline stocks, passenger traffic, economic indicators like production index and Brent crude oil prices) using ARDL and SVAR.

📅 Forecasting with Prophet
Leverage Facebook’s Prophet library to assess its effectiveness in predicting future trends in airline stocks.
