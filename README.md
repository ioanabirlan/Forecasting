Airline Stocks & Tourism Forecasting Project
This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the airline industry by applying a wide range of econometric, statistical, and machine learning models. By focusing on forecasting, risk estimation, and dynamic relationships, we uncover key insights into the tourism sector.

Main Objectives

Forecasting Trends
Build accurate forecasting models using SARIMA, State Space Models, and deep learning (RNN) to capture seasonality, trends, and structural factors affecting airline stocks.

Volatility Estimation
Apply ARCH-GARCH models to analyze stock price volatility, offering insights into market risk and investor sentiment in the tourism sector.

Spectral Analysis
Use spectral analysis techniques to detect cyclic patterns and seasonal periodicities in airline stock movements.

Multivariate Analysis
Investigate the causal and dynamic relationships between airline stocks and passenger traffic using VAR, multivariate GARCH, and SVAR models.

Long-Term Equilibrium
Explore long-run equilibrium relationships between tourism-related variables (airline stocks, passenger traffic, economic indicators like production index and Brent crude oil prices) using ARDL and SVAR.

Forecasting with Prophet
Leverage Facebook’s Prophet library to assess its effectiveness in predicting future trends in airline stocks.

Methodologies Used
Time Series Models: SARIMA, State Space Models, Prophet

Volatility Models: ARCH-GARCH, Multivariate GARCH
